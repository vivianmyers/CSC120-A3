Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Which classmates did you consult with while working on this assignment?

Sophia Kwak, Ruby Hong

- Which session(s) of TA / office hours did you attend?

Sunday 1-3pm. They helped me test weird cases (like if round s= 0, more than one mirror word)

- What are your initial impressions of Java? 

It is a lot more tedious than python, but this can help me make less mistakes.
u
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 

Flexibility vs structure (java focuses on structure while python focuses on flexibility. Both have their pros and cons but show the versatility of programming)

Speed vs simplicity (java is faster but python is simpler. Again, both have their pros and cons)

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Worked: creating a general frame work (conversation loop) and adding detail from there, helper methods

Didn't work: Trying to accomplish the entire project the first time through.

Advice: Make helper methods to keep your code simple and readable or else you will probably get lost and confused
